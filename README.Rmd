Some fixed-width files (fwf) are created with a complementary data dictionary. Such dictionaries contain metadata such as column widths, variable types, and variable labels. The `{fixer}` package reads fixed-width files according to their data dictionary. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of fixer like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("tgerke/fixer")
```

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Currently launching into the primary function as so:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(fixer)

debugonce("read_fwf_dd")

fwiffer:::read_fwf_example("example-fwf-dictionary.dd") |> 
  read_fwf_dd(skip = 2)
```
